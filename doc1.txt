Here are 20 must-know updates and tips to get started with Kubernetes:

1. Always start with `kubectl` – it's your gateway to the cluster.
2. Use Minikube or Kind to practice Kubernetes locally.
3. Master the YAML syntax – it's everywhere in Kubernetes.
4. Learn the difference between Deployments, StatefulSets, and DaemonSets.
5. Namespace everything to avoid conflicts in multi-team setups.
6. Use ConfigMaps and Secrets to separate configuration from code.
7. Set up resource requests/limits to prevent pod starvation.
8. Understand Kubernetes Services – ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
9. Learn about Ingress for HTTP routing into your cluster.
10. Use liveness and readiness probes to manage container health.
11. Avoid storing credentials in plain YAML files – use Secrets instead.
12. Familiarize yourself with Helm for managing application releases.
13. Explore Kustomize for environment-specific configuration.
14. Use metrics-server for resource monitoring.
15. Set up Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for secure operations.
16. Start with a simple CNI plugin like Flannel for networking.
17. Use Kubernetes Dashboard cautiously – it's great for beginners but can expose your cluster.
18. Experiment with auto-scaling – both HPA (pods) and Cluster Autoscaler (nodes).
19. Regularly clean up unused resources like pods, services, and images.
20. Document everything – Kubernetes has a steep learning curve.
